# Embedded PostgreSQL for GO

This project is a port https://github.com/ilya-murzinov/postgres-embedded for GO

The goal is to make a local Postgres instance available for tests

For a usage example please check the file src/postgresql_test.go


## Supported Platforms
I have only tested in MacOS although it should work on Linux as well
